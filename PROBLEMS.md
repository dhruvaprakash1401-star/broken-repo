\# Problems Found in the Repository



1\. Compiled executable files were generated during program execution and remained in the repository root directory.



2\. Temporary files and log files were created outside the designated output directory, cluttering the repository.



3\. The repository did not include a `.gitignore` file, causing generated artifacts to appear as untracked files after execution.
