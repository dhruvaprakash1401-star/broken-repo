\# Assignment 1 – Sensor Data Logger Repository Cleanup



\## Description

This repository contains a C++ program that simulates a simple sensor data logging system.

When executed, the program generates sensor readings and stores the results as output files.



The goal of this assignment is not to modify the program logic, but to correct the repository

structure and apply proper GitHub and version control practices.



\## Output Directory

The `output/` directory contains the valid and meaningful output files generated by the program

after execution. These files represent the results of the sensor data logging process.



No other generated files such as executables, temporary files, or logs are tracked in the

repository.
